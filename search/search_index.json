This is just a general rule as there are always exceptions and we do not expect you to memorize every detail. Below are some notable exceptions and suggestions:</p> <ul> <li>SWAT variable names - the SWAT model uses shorthand names for its input and output variables. In older coding projects referencing these inputs/outputs, these names as well as other acronyms were written in UPPERCASE. This practice should only continue in legacy projects. For all new projects, please adhere to the following conventions:<ul> <li>Only capitalize the first letter, e.g., <code>Hru</code> and not <code>HRU</code> or <code>hru</code></li> <li>Underscores while generally not preferred, may be left intact if it matches the name of a SWAT variable, e.g. <code>Crop_yld</code> and not <code>CropYld</code>, <code>Crop_Yld</code>, or <code>Cropyld</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>Project names and name spaces - in general it is preferred to have a common prefix to your project name (e.g. SWAT or HAWQS, written as Swat and Hawqs respectively). Separate words with a period, and only capitalize the first letter of acronyms (historically, this captilization is not always followed in old projects; please adopt going forward). If your solution has multiple projects, name them by function, e.g., <code>Hawqs.Web</code>, <code>Hawqs.Business</code>, <code>Hawqs.Data</code>. If you have a single project but it is part of a common model or entity, prefix with this common word, e.g., <code>Swat.Conferences</code> or <code>Swat.Website</code>.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#javascript-typescript-vuejs","title":"JavaScript / TypeScript / Vue.js","text":"<p>Most JavaScript projects utilize Vue.js.
